		Implement a registry for p2pxwiki name resolution. 
<br>
<br>
There is a central registry for name resolution. The central registry
allows for the wiki names to be distinguishable. Also it helps in
solving the problem of wiki-hijacking. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* extension: central registry can be replicated between a set of servers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* extension: central registry functionality can
be handed by peers. There will be a need for ensuring the integrity of
the registry data in this case.

		There are few choices -
<br>
<br>
a) It is simpler to implement our own protocol solution for the
<br>
registry, however, it may not be very scalable and extensible.
<br>
Therefore, I will explore how we can leverage some existing solution.
<br>
<br>
b) The p2pxwiki.com domain can be hosted on a machine which acts as
<br>
the "primary" authority for p2pxwiki virtual name registration. This
<br>
"primary" registry can later be replicated at any peer in a secure
<br>
manner (using certificates perhaps to ensure and verify the integrity
<br>
of the registry).  Actually, this replication architecture will be
<br>
very much like wiki replication. In wiki replication, peers need to
<br>
ensure that they are getting the correct copies of the wiki from
<br>
another peer whereas in the case of a registry, we need to ensure that
<br>
a domain name resolves to a correct ip address. The same principle
<br>
will avoid wiki hijacking as well as denial of service (because of
<br>
incorrect name resolution due to a malicious peers). I am sure similar
<br>
issues arise in traditional DNS, i will look into how it is solved and
<br>
if there is any implementation.
<br>
<br>
c) Once we replicate the registry to peers, the role of the central
<br>
registry will primarily be to ensure that the wiki names are unique
<br>
(i.e., cnn.p2pxwiki.com is not assigned to more than 1 master peer).
<br>
The mapping of name to IP address can in principle be resolved through
<br>
p2p discovery (some form of flooding) and need not go to central
<br>
registry.
<br>
<br>
I need to look at existing solutions on how they solve (b) in
<br>
particualr. I will explore today before proposing a spec for the
<br>
registry. I donot want to spend too much time looking at other
<br>
existing solutions, but at the same time, it is too easy to design our
<br>
own solution that may require significant effort later for scalability
<br>
and extensibility - so at the minimum i will need to come up with a
<br>
spec for the registry and identify what can be leveraged.
<br>
<br>
For an initial prototype demonstration, we donot need anything beyond
<br>
configuring the existing DNS Server at xwiki.com to divert
<br>
p2p.xwiki.com to a machine running the registry (after i have
<br>
developed it). Also p2pxwiki.com domain name needs to be registered
<br>
and needs to resolve to the machine which will run the registry. We do
<br>
not necessarily need a separate hosting at this point, we can use one
<br>
of the existing xwiki machines if it is ok.

I don't think writing a DNS implementation in java is an option
(especially given the tight schedule for this project). I'd rather go
to a solution involving a DNS server that can use a SQL backend, such
as PowerDNS (<a href="http://www.powerdns.com/">http://www.powerdns.com/</a>) or mydns (<a href="http://mydns.bboy.net/">http://mydns.bboy.net/</a>)
and update the database through a web service (need to take great care
of security here) then we enjoy their debugged server code !
<br>
<br>We also need to think about implementing some redundancy into this
service, because we loose some benefits of being P2P by relying on a
central repository.

		Hey Bikash,
<br>
<br>My comment went in before i read your own comment. IMHO, a) b) and
c) describe the DNS system. So i don't see any reason to change it.
<br>
<br>More specifically, about (b). The replication scheme is obviously
implemented in most DNS servers. A DNS master server is Authoritative
for a zone and replicates it to any server which has been declared as a
slave DNS server for it. The whois records list all the DNS servers for
a particular domain (NS) records. You also have DNS caches that are
implemented at each ISP level and cache the information they receive
from the master DNS. Your architecture has to take this caching system
in account (if we wouldn't cache the information, the DNS traffic even
on xwiki.com will be higher that the HTTP, and the time to resolve any
server's name before making a single request would be huge).
<br>
<br>
a whois on xwiki.com answers you :
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name Server: LANAI.XPERTNET.BIZ
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name Server: MAUI.XPERTNET.BIZ
<br>
<br>
Then if we look at the DNS configuration for xwiki.com :
<br>
<br>
mac:~ erwan$ host -t NS xwiki.com   
<br>
xwiki.com name server maui.xpertnet.biz.
<br>
xwiki.com name server lanai.xpertnet.biz.
<br>
<br>
and then, on lanai.xpertnet.biz (our DNS master) :
<br>
<br>
zone "xwiki.com" {
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type master;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file "/etc/bind/xwiki.com.hosts";
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
<br>
<br>
and finally, on maui (our DNS slave) :
<br>
<br>
zone "xwiki.com" {
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type slave;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;masters {
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.0.8;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file "/var/cache/bind/xwiki.com.hosts";
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
<br>
<br>
(192.168.0.8 is lanai's internal IP address).
<br>
<br>
I really think a DNS server with a MySQL backend updated by your application will do the job.

		Thanks Erwan, 
<br>
I have been out of email touch the whole day and got back to your email just now -

<br>
I am looking at mydns, it's a "free" dns server for unix, so i believe we can directly use it. 
<br>
<br>I am not sure how the mydns server will work in a p2p setting, i.e,
can a peer be allowed to participate in name resolution or is it going
to be restricted to ISPs ? </td></tr>

		I don't think making name resolution P2P in our own zone is a good idea.
<br>
<br>
- any peer elected as DNS server will be able to hijack the DNS of p2p.xwiki.com (or p2pwiki.com) for his own purpose
<br>
<br>
- i don't see any benefit over the standard master/slave architecture
where a master server that we manage is replicated to slaves and caches
all across the Internet.
<br>
<br>- there might be a TTL (Time To Live) problem when creating a new
entry (server) in the zone, but it can be alleviated by reducing the
said TTL. I mean that changes take a certain time to be replicated on
the slaves. The TTL parameter allow to reduce this time, but increase
the load on the servers.
<br>
<br>
Proposal:
<br>
<br>
- install mydns or pdns on a test server. If you need one i guess we can provide you with a test environment.
<br>
- implement a webapp/webservice that updates the server's backend 
<br>
- check that you can insert/remove/update records
<br>
- verify that name resolution works with your server using standard NS debugging tools (host, dig, zonecheck ...)

It's a tough choice, wether to use the peers for the resolution or not.
As Erwan has stated, the DNS system is redundant and fail-safe as
itself, so the reason for using peers for the name resolution should
not be a question of availability. However the load of all the p2p
clients connected to the central registry to gather the information
back to the central database could be crazy.
<br>
<br>
However when we first discussed resolution, we had been talking about using redirections.. 
<br>
<br>ludovic.p2p.xwiki.com could send the IP of the closest node and
then you would be either servered directly by the node (which relays)
or redirected to ludovic.peer.p2p.xwiki.com (a peer serving the wiki)
or ludovic.local.p2p.xwiki.com (yourself because you have a copy) or
ludovic.orig.p2p.xwiki.com (the master wiki).
<br>
<br>This could be a way to involve the peers in the name resolution..
Only the nodes would be connected to the central registry. Individual
users would be connected to a set of nodes. The nodes would send back
the info about the users to the central wiki.
<br>
<br>Something like that needs to be designed otherwise it's not going
to work. In terms of load it's important to state that the P2P installs
need to have some permanent connection to the network one way or
another.
<br>
<br>
PS: we don't need to build everything right away, but the architecture needs to be scalable.

		I've made a proposal for the P2P Name resolution using a diagram with Inkscape (SVG) on the wiki: <a href="http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Dev/Design+Issues/p2pxwiki-resolution.png">http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Dev/Design+Issues/p2pxwiki-resolution.png</a>
<br>
<br>The idea is that the P2P XWiki's are connected permanently using
nodes. The permanent connections allow to send information up the
permanent connection to give the localisation of the P2P client to the
central registry.
<br>
<br>DNS resolution would then either send back the IP of the closest
node if the P2P client is behing a firewall or send back the IP of the
machine itself. If a other P2P client has a replica of a wiki his IP or
the closest node could also be valid IP's in the DNS registry.
<br>
<br>Now with this system the availability is dependent on the
availability of the central registry and the DNS cluster. This system
needs to be designed to be clustered and solid (2 datacenters). This
single point of failure is the price to pay to be compatible with
standard browsers and not only users having the P2P XWiki client.
<br>
<br>The P2P XWiki client could work only by querying the node which
finds other wikis using the node system. That could be an enhancement
for the users of the P2P XWiki (working without the central registry by
discovering close users). </td></tr>

		Thanks Ludovic, Erwin -  good discussions. I have few questions - 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;a. Who will be the slaves ? how does the master decide who the slaves are? 
<br>
what will be the protocol for master-slave communication and how much
of it is new implementation vs existing implementation in mydns. <br>
<br>

Action Plan for SoC 
<br>
<br>
1/ I will start with the action plan that Erwin outlined with
implementation for redirection and host resolution. Security and
Firewall traversal are the issues are the ones that will be taken care
of in the future. <br>
<br>
2/ inorder for ludovic.p2p.xwiki.com to be resolved correctly, there
needs to be some changes to the xwiki.com dns server - so that it can
invoke a web service call to mydns and return the correct ip address. I
will need a test platform for this. <br>

		a. Who will be the slaves ? how does the master decide who the slaves are?
<br>
what will be the protocol for master-slave communication and how much
of it is new implementation vs existing implementation in mydns.
<br>
<br>Both the P2P Clients and the Nodes can be slaves or masters.. I
think the master/slave replication has nothing to do with mydns.. The
DNS will be only at the central registry. The P2P clients and Nodes
will have to inform the central registry of the list of wikis that they
are able to serve. They will also say (using the username/password that
their are the master for specific wikis). The central registry will
update the mydns database with the right IP address.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;b. The "node" in the diagram are I assume slaves. Are they
specially designated peers or ISP hosts or some hosts managed by
"p2pxwiki.com" (the master) for load sharing?
<br>
<br>From my point of view they would be user. Only the central registry
would be our own servers (I'm not sure how to call them, ISP hosts or
managed by p2pxwiki.com). If necessary it could be possible to manually
setup some nodes in some places to improve the capacity and reliability
on the network. It's clear that peers won't be able to efficiently
handle a lot of connections. Nodes that we managed could handle more.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;c. As I understand, in the diagram, there is another
component that "makes a decision" as to which peer should be used to
serve a particular wiki based on load sharing. It can be simple
heuristic to start with (serve from local machine if available,
otherwise pick one of the other peers, which have the read-only copy,
at random. I am not sure how the implementation of "closest peer" will
work? ).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>There are two issues to solve. Issue 1 is passing firewalls using
the closest 'node' (there is no load balancing here and this is what I
was talking about). Here instead of sending the peer IP address to the
central registry it's the node IP that goes in the central registry and
DNS server.
<br>
<br>The second issue is when replication is in place, how to choose the
right peer based on the IP address of the requester. Indeed random or
round robin is the easy choice that will work right away probably
without mydns changes. Closest peer could be handled using some
geolocalisation (there are some public databases of location - at least
countries - of IP addresses). If the IP are on the same network it
could be an easy solution too. I know akamai has done some work in this
area so it is possible to build huge database on the best choices. This
won't be possible right away, but we can suppose that in a future
release mydns would be modified to ask an external function for the
best solution among the existing replicas: String getBestIP(String
RequestorIP,String[] ReplicaIPs) <br>
<br>
&nbsp;d. firewall traversal: Any of the "nodes" in the diagram can act
as intermediary in case of firewall or does the central registry act as
the intermediary for all firewall traversals?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>The nodes... Nodes have to accept HTTP connections and would relay
them to one of their P2P clients permanently connected to them using an
upstream connection.. In a first release, the central registry could be
the only node available, but the architecture should be build to have
mutiple nodes and level of nodes.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;e. There is security concern related to how the dns will be
updated... There is security problem related to redirection as well. I
don't sufficiently understand how mydns work, so i think i will explore
this later once i have a basic implementation, is this reasonable?
Having a separate discussion on security may be a good idea.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>Let's suppose the nodes are trusted (so if a node sends back info
to the central registry then it's fine.. This probably means
communications needs to be signed). P2P clients are authenticated when
connected to the nodes. They are the only master for their own wikis.
That info is sent back from the nodes to the central registry. There is
an issue with declaring having a complete replica of a wiki.. This
could be handled using a hashcode.. Now once the request goes to the
peer, the peer can serve whatever it wants.. I don't think the HTTP
only version can validate what another peer is sending back.. only a
P2P client could validate what another peer is sending back.. I'm not
sure we want to solve this right away or even at all.. <br>
<br>
Action Plan for SoC
<br>
<br>
1/ I will start with the action plan that Erwin outlined with
implementation for redirection and host resolution. Security and
Firewall traversal are the issues are the ones that will be taken care

Ok
<br>
<br>2/ inorder for ludovic.p2p.xwiki.com to be resolved correctly,
there needs to be some changes to the xwiki.com dns server - so that it
can invoke a web service call to mydns and return the correct ip
address. I will need a test platform for this.
<br>
<br>Ok.. we'll look at what we can do.. I think I will take
p2pxwiki.com so we can have everything separate for now... We will
setup a mydns server with a database somewhere and open that database
from updates from java over the internet.. once we have this you could
have a central registry anywhere that updates the database. In
production the central registry would probably be on the same machine.
<br>
<br>I think you can also set that up for testing on your local machine
(that might be more efficient to verify you can update the DB fine). </td></tr>

Thanks Ludovic for the clarifications, I will start with setting up

		The p2pxwiki Design Decisions: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A master-slave architecture, where the
creator of the wiki is the master. Others are slaves. Master is on a
wiki by wiki basis as opposed to pages or all the wikis. So a sinlge
wiki is the granularity for replication/consistency.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The master need to be present for the edits on that particular wiki by other peers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o
extension: allow a peer to access a wiki when the master is offline by
handing off master rights
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* There is a central registry for name
resolution. The central registry allows for the wiki names to be
distinguishable. Also it helps in solving the problem of
wiki-hijacking. More on this is in the discussion at the link above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o
extension: central registry can be replicated between a set of servers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o
extension: central registry functionality can be handed by peers. There
will be a need for ensuring the integrity of the registry data in this
case.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The registry need to be present before a new wiki can be created.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow a user to access p2pxwiki without
the p2pxwiki software by contacting a hosting service. This helps in
having a wiki at a public place accessible by everyone with a browser.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow a user to create a new wiki by
downloading the software p2pxwiki. This provides some motivation for
users to dedicate space for replicating other people's wiki. For only
accessing other people's wiki, user need not download the software.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Allow the user to get xwiki from other
users for read only when the user is not connected to the master or the
internet. The replicas at other peers are for a complete wiki and are
full read-only replicas.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o extension: Allow a user to write to a xwiki while offline
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Extension: Allow two offline users to share a wiki in read/write mode.

		User Story 1    :: Offline XWiki 
<br>
<br>
John, a CNN news reporter, is on-board an airplane, and is scheduled to arrive 
<br>
in Atlanta at 3pm. He is returning after attending a conference on recent 
<br>
developments in media technology. CNN is scheduled to release a report on his 
<br>
experience at 4:10pm. He hears the announcement: "This is your captain speaking,
<br>
due to bad weather, the scheduled arrival time to Atlanta is now 4pm, please 
<br>
enjoy your coffee..." His heart skips a bit at the thought of missing the 
<br>
scheduled broadcast ! Suddenly he realizes that the AirBus is equipped 
<br>
with wireless connectivity, however because of bad weather, the connection will
<br>
be intermittent at best. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offline XWiki comes to his rescue. He takes out his laptop, and starts 
<br>
working on the report that is due immediately upon arrival. He continues editing
<br>
the report and the updated changes are sent to his colleague Sara for review 
<br>
through the intermittent wireless connection. John and Sara work on the story 
<br>
together, with John doing most of the edits and Sara taking care of linking 
<br>
to other related reports and fixing typos. As the plane approaches Atlanta, 
<br>
the connection to the Internet improves, and he submits his final changes. 
<br>
Sara in CNN office is immediately notified of final changes, combines her edits 
<br>
with John's changes, and sends it immediately to John for final 
<br>
review. John, while waiting to get off the plane, notices that Sara has 
<br>
updated the report, reviews it before getting off and tells Sara that it looks 
<br>
good (as his watches the clock ticking 4:05pm !)  
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara immediately hand off a copy of the news to the producer and the news is 
<br>
broadcast as scheduled at 4:10 ! XWiki saves the day one more time, and both 
<br>
John  and Sara are commended on the great story.

		User Story 2  :: Sharing of multiple pages
<br>
<br>
Not long ago, in a place not far away ...
<br>
<br>
There was a company, called "noname", in the business of bringing
<br>
uptodate news to the people. The organization structure of the company
<br>
was complex - with different people in charge of bringing different
<br>
stories. Heather was in charge of weather, S. Ports was in charge of
<br>
sports. For Business there was Minesh, and for Politics there was
<br>
Kudovics. Each person works on different stories and has to travel
<br>
frequently, many times to locations with weak or no
<br>
infrastructure. Moreover, everyone has to confer with the others and
<br>
relate to other reports to make a compelling story. For this, they
<br>
used to fly to the headquarter and have a conference meeting before
<br>
each news broadcast, costing "noname" lots of money in travel
<br>
expenses. Moreover, once the meeting is over and there was no easy way
<br>
to incorporate further changes made by other.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Then came P2PXWiki - it saved name for "noname" and changed the way
<br>
communication happened. Heather, S. Ports, Minesh, and Kudovics formed
<br>
a peer-group and could communicate with each other as peers at
<br>
different physical locations even with weak connectivities. All of
<br>
them worked on different stories frequently exchanging comments. For
<br>
instance, Heather predicts rainy weather in Atlanta for the next two
<br>
days, and consequently, S. Ports announces bad day for the local
<br>
sports.  As soon as changes are made in one news story, it is
<br>
propagated to other members of the group. Everyone can comment on each
<br>
others story, and refer to it easily while reporting their section of
<br>
the news. Real-time communications within the peer-group ensured that
<br>
each story was most up-to-date, comprehensive, and is published as it
<br>
happened.
<br>
<br>
P2PXwiki saved "noname" a lot of money in financial expenses, and beat
<br>
the rival "some-name" in popularity! Soon Heather, S. Ports, Minesh
<br>
and Kudovics became famous and their team called the "WikiNews"!
<br>
<br>
PS: All characters in this story are fictional.. any resemblence to
<br>
anyone is purely intentional :) 
<br>
<br>
PPS: I am just trying something for fun, other stories won't probably be
<br>
like this one... Please send  me a message if you think I am going overboard.

		User Story 3 :: Multiple wikis being shared Example of content sharing
<br>
<br>John is on a road-trip with his family after a busy week at work.
Being a very busy professional, he had limited time to plan his trip in
detail. John knew that their road-trip to the Aquarium goes through
many interesting places - although he didn't have all the details.
However, he also knew that XWiki will help him out. <br>
<br>
While John drives, his wife Martha takes out the laptop and starts
searching for information on interesting places nearby by connecting to
other peer travelers. XWiki automatically detects other nearby
travelers and connects them as peers while each of them possibly
travels at 70 miles per hour on the interstate. Martha find out by
looking at the wiki of a nearby peer that there is a mini-golf course
nearby. Looking for something more exciting, she starts searching for
information on "scenic places" through the peer-network. Through the
P2PXwiki network, she finds information and route to the fabulous
"smokey mountains" nearby. She even looks at interesting pictures taken
by others on their prior trip to "smokey mountain". She shows them to
John and they both decide to stop by the "smokeys" to enjoy the
breathtaking views. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, their 12 year old son who likes solving puzzles, is playing
with his IPAQ. His IPAQ is equiped with XWiki. He starts connecting his
XWiki with other peers, and searches for "ongoing puzzles". Sure
enough, he finds other fellow travelers playing different games. The
name "Lateral Puzzles" caught his attention and he joins the game. The
game works as follows: the host posts a situation, and the other
players try to find a logical explanation of the puzzle by asking
questions. The host provides only "yes/no" answers to the questions,
and other players use it as clues to solve the puzzle. Junior John also
joins the game and starts following up questions by other peers and
asks his questions to solve the puzzle. There is a murder mystery to
solve - "A man is lying dead in a field. Next to him there is an
unopened package. There is no other creature in the field. How did he
die?". Some fellow passenger had asked - "did he die from hunger"?The
host replied "no", another question followed "Did he die of
sunstroke?", "no" came the answer in wiki comment from the host.. John
Jr. joins the game and starts asking question of his own... <br>
<br>
As they approached the smokey mountains, John and Martha get ready to
take exciting pictures and enjoy the view, and by the time they get off
the car, their son has solved a murder mystery and tells his parents
how happy he is. It turned out that - The man had jumped from a plane
but his parachute had failed to open. It is the unopened package that
is lying in the field. <br>
<br>
John and Martha are very happy at their experience, having used XWiki
to locate smokey mountains, and helping their son do useful mental
exercise through the game ! They share their experience with other
travelers on their way back. <br>

		User Story 4 :: More delay between updates and possibly conflicting updates
<br>
<br>
<br>
Xwiki is widely used in the classrooms for interaction between students
and teacher. Mike, a student in "Introduction to CS" class frequently
takes notes during the class and shares it on the wiki. Other fellow
students also share their notes taken during the class on the class
wiki. The Class Wiki allows sharing of notes among students and also
helps the instructor in understanding any concerns of the class
allowing better communication during subsequent lectures. Simultaneous
updates by students often give rise to conflicts on the same page,
however xwiki automatically resolves most of the conflicts since
contents are mostly additions to a page. On some rare occasions, it
takes input from the person doing the updates in resolving conflicts. <br>
<br>
Students often look at notes at home and away from the classroom.
P2PXWiki allows students to access the classroom notes when offline -
which is sometimes the case when they are at home because of parental
control. When connected with other students, XWiki automatically takes
care of sending the updated contents to other students and the
instructor facilitating class discussions. <br>

		User Story 5 :: Security (I share my wiki with a friend)
<br>
<br>
John, our frequent traveler, has very different security requirements
<br>
from our WikiNews team ! While traveling on vacation, John likes to share
<br>
his content with other fellow travelers freely. He selects 
<br>
communication channel within p2pxwiki that allows anyone to login and
<br>
share contents with any other available peers. John can even select
<br>
anonymous connections whereby only limited information from his profile
<br>
will be shared with the peers without revealing his complete identity. 
<br>
<br>
The WikiNews team, on the other hand, work in a group and with much
<br>
stricter security requirements. Competition from rival news companies
<br>
means that all communication within the group should be secure and
<br>
authenticated. The communication data should travel through secure
<br>
channels and only allowed from authorized members of the group. P2PXwiki
<br>
facilitates this by a simple user option to select completely secure
<br>
channels while establishing  communication within the peer group. All the
<br>
details concerning authentication, authorization, confidentiality, and 
<br>
data integrity is handled by the underlying communication layer.

		After looking at the programmer's guide <a href="http://www.jxta.org/docs/JxtaProgGuide_v2.3.pdf,">http://www.jxta.org/docs/JxtaProgGuide_v2.3.pdf,</a> <br>
here is a small summary of features in JXTA. 
<br>
<br>
- key design goal: modular
<br>
<br>
- The essential aspects of the architecture are: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ The use of XML documents (advertisements) to describe network resources.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Abstraction of pipes to peers, and peers to endpoints without reliance
<br>
upon a central naming/addressing authority such as DNS.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ A uniform peer addressing scheme (peer IDs)
<br>
<br>
<br>
- JXTA allows peers to be combined together to form a group. It provides
<br>
basic services such as discovery service - to search for peer group
<br>
resources; membership service - to accept/reject new membership
<br>
applications to a group by group members collectively; access service -
<br>
validate requests made by one peer to another; pipe service - to create and
<br>
manage pipe connections among peers; resolver service - to send generic
<br>
query requests to other peers; and monitoring service - to allow monitoring
<br>
of other peers in the same group. 
<br>
<br>
- All peer belong to a default group to start with. The groups
<br>
form parent/child relationship and form a hierarchy. Moreover, one peer
<br>
can be part of multiple groups. 
<br>
<br>
- The services are broken down into peer services and peer group services. 
<br>
<br>
- Pipes: JXTA peers use pipes to send messages to one another. Pipes
<br>
are asynchronous, unidirectional and unreliable. pipe endpoints are
<br>
dynamically bound to peer endpoints at runtime. pipes can have endpoints
<br>
that are connected to different peers at different times, or may not be
<br>
connected at all. JXTA also provides secure unicast pipes, a secure and
<br>
reliable variant of unicast pipes. There is a reliable library and 
<br>
socket interface that is provided as two way communication channel on top
<br>
of unidirectional pipes. 
<br>
<br>
- Security: JXTA considers all aspects of security - confidentiality -
<br>
contents of messages are not disclosed; authentication: guarantees that
<br>
sender is who he/she claims to be; authorization: guarantees that sender
<br>
is authorized to send; data integrity: guarantees that message was not
<br>
modified accidentally or intentionally in transit; refutability: guarantees
<br>
that message is transmitted by properly identified sender and is not a
<br>
replay of an earlier message. 
<br>
<br>
Verdict: It appears to be a good place to bootstrap the implementation for developing p2pxwiki prototype.

Hi Bikash, due to NAT handling of JXTA, in my point of view JXTA would
be more extensible, but i dont know much. You must know better. Just

		I just browsed through Jgroups main page [<a href="http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/overview.html">http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/overview.html</a>]
and see that it's goal is different. it is a communication library for
building applications that need reliable mutlicast. It is quite
different from JXTA - JXTA has group membership but main goal is to
make it easier to develop p2p applications by providing some common
features - such as peer discovery, peer registration, NAT so that peers
can be behind firewalls, haterogeneous devices support - a peer can be
ipaq, linux, windows machine etc... JXTA may in principle use Jgroups
for group communication among peers when reliable multicast is needed. <br>
<br>
I am going to bootstrap the p2pxwiki implementation using some of the
capabilities of JXTA, since I expect it will be easier and faster to
use JXTA capabilities for peer discovery, registration than writing
something of our own. </td></tr>

		I saw an "interesting" project called p2psockets (<a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org/docs/tutorials/2.html#footnote5">http://p2psockets.jxta.org/docs/tutorials/2.html#footnote5</a>)
built on top of JXTA. This project provides the standard socket APIs
using p2p network (hiding the complexity of peer discovery and binding
behind the scene). The interesting aspect is it has been used to
develop Peer-to-Peer Web Servers, Servlets, JSPs, and XML-RPC Clients
and Servers. <br>
<br>
The webpage above even gives Wiki as an example application that can be built using p2psockets. It gives JSPWiki (<a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp">http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp</a>)
as an example- I am not sure if JSPWiki uses p2psockets (my first
impression is that JSPWiki is used as a generic example of a wiki, and
not necessarily something that uses p2psockets). <br>
<br>
I wanted to document some of my experience with p2psockets so far: 
<br>
It is claimed that servlets work right out of the box without any
modifications, by using the included modified webserver with p2psockets
(the webserver is a modification of Jetty). I tried this by using the
xwiki war but couldn't get it to work. <br>
<br>
Using p2psocket to build p2pxwiki is an interesting design option that
can be explored. It may ease the implementation effort, however many
issues such as replication, registry to allow uniqueness in wiki names,
browser based access without changing any configuration on client side
(p2psocket advocates using a proxy on the client that talks to a
p2psocket based proxy server) still remain. However, it may be worth
exploring. <br>

This is really interesting.. You should indeed reuse the Jetty port,
the XML-RPC client and the Smart Cache module (which allows HTTP
access).
<br>
<br>If you have a smart cache module (or a modification of it) on nodes
(machines not behind firewalls), they can relay standard browser over
the P2P network..
<br>
<br>Otherwise your P2P client would be a modified jetty to be jxta
aware with a xwiki behind it. Replication would occur transparently
through the modified xml-rpc client to go over the P2Psockets.. The
smart cache node would be added on top of it to accept HTTP requests
from standard browser.
<br>
<br>You still need to registry I think to tell the browser or anybody
who has a copy of the wiki.. This can function using XML-RPC calls over
the modified xml-rpc client to call the "registry" peer..
<br>
<br>So you need to implement XML-RPC method for the registry updates.
The registry plugin would still update the DNS (unless you find a way
using P2Psockets to handle the DNS issue).

Using p2psockets at present is going to be significant debugging
exercise with perhaps lots of surprises ! The reason is that the
website <a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org/">http://p2psockets.jxta.org/</a>
says the project has completed its research goals on 6/15/05. I checked
the mailing lists and don't see much communication - the developer
mailing list has 30 emails in 14 months with some of them spams. <br>
also the release file i downloaded doesn't have source code for xml-rpc
port or any examples on how to use it. I looked at the jar, and instead
of apache's org.apache.xmlrpc.WebServer class, the port has
org.apache.xmlrpc.P2PWebServer; which means the code written with
apache's xml-rpc won't work as it is without changes as claimed ! I may
be wrong about this, but there is no examples/docs in the release to
show correct usage. <br>
<br>
So, I think p2psockets is premature at this stage to be used by us,
using it requires significant hack. I will instead just use another
xml-rpc port on jxta (<a href="http://xmlrpc.jxta.org/">http://xmlrpc.jxta.org/</a>) to build the registry which i need to develop anyway.

Yes.. I was worried about that but didn't have time to actually look at
the code itself. I also so the Smart Cache is not actually usable. It's
only a proxy that needs to be run locally.
<br>
<br>
So you actually need the registry anyway for standard clients to actually know where the user is.
<br>
<br>Using xmlrpc.jxta.org seems interesting to call XWiki through jxta
seems interesting. If you implement an xml-rpc method that stores the
peer wiki IP in the central xwiki and calls the registry plugin to
store the IP in the powerdns database this should work. </td></tr>

		&nbsp;Project Title
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;P2P XWiki
<br>
<br>
Synopsis
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This project would be a very ambitious project of creating a P2P
<br>
XWiki which would allow users to run an XWiki locally and
<br>
automatically synchronize it with other XWiki users using P2P
<br>
technologies. It would be an extension of the "offline" wiki but
<br>
without any central wiki and being much more real-time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Benefits to the Community
<br>
&nbsp;The project will make XWiki faster and fault tolerant. Moreover,
<br>
Xwiki is one of the few projects with the WYSIWYG editor where there
<br>
is significant obstacles to make it distributed. The current Xwiki
<br>
client consults a centralized server. Enabling communication with
<br>
other clients, providing conflict management on a document by document
<br>
basis will make it truly distributed and efficient.
<br>
<br>
Deliverables
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1/ Java program allowing to synchronize a local wiki with a remote
<br>
(centrally located) wiki and handle conflicts. XWiki uses CVS for
<br>
visioning its files so conflict management should be possible and
<br>
provided through an interface. Users would access the local wiki
<br>
through their usual web interface.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2/ Implement a P2P protocol which would allow to have no central
<br>
server containing the wiki data. Documents would be synched from user
<br>
to user on a document by document basis. Conflicts management will be
<br>
needed. I will explore various design choices and pick the ``best''. A
<br>
central server can be kept (or not) to manage the participant lists. A
<br>
system for security is needed (a key ? PGP keys ? something else
<br>
?). Sync could be manual or automated (near-real-time).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3/ Optional: Eclipse RCP client embedding Gekko and managing the
<br>
remote/P2P aspects of XWiki, manage the sync conflicts and adding some
<br>
cool XWiki interface navigation features (spaces, documents, active
<br>
users, etc..). The XWiki content would be shown using the embedded
<br>
Gekko component.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Project Details
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listed with the same numbering as deliverables:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1/ I will be using the existing Xwiki client while providing support
<br>
to handle conflicts (communicating with a centralized
<br>
server). Conflict management is the biggest part of this work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2/ This deliverable includes some unresolved issues and is very
<br>
interesting. I will discuss these issues (most of which are solved
<br>
problems, I will need to decide on the right tools) and design
<br>
prototype. Implementing protocols for peer discovery, protocols for
<br>
discovering versions of documents, and providing conflict management
<br>
is a first step. There is right management in the current wiki and
<br>
APIs that use the right management. I will also explore if the present
<br>
right management in Wiki can be extended to the p2p architecture as
<br>
the second step.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3/ If I can implement XWiki interface for the features I implement
<br>
in (2) within the time-frame, that will be awesome! It will depend on
<br>
how much of Eclipse RCP, and Gekko I have to learn and how much I can
<br>
reuse. I will like to try it as well.

		Project Title
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;P2P XWiki 
<br>
<br>
Synopsis (from website) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This project would be a very ambitious project of creating a P2P
<br>
XWiki which would allow users to run an XWiki locally and
<br>
automatically synchronize it with other XWiki users using P2P
<br>
technologies. It would be an extension of the "offline" wiki but
<br>
without any central wiki and being much more real-time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Benefits to the Community
<br>
&nbsp;The project will make XWiki faster and fault tolerant. Moreover,
<br>
Xwiki is one of the few projects with the WYSIWYG editor where there
<br>
is significant obstacles to make it distributed. The current Xwiki
<br>
client consults a centralized server. Enabling communication with
<br>
other clients, providing conflict management on a document by document
<br>
basis will make it truly distributed and efficient.
<br>
<br>

Project Schedule
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have have started exploring the websites
<br>
(<a href="http://xwiki.objectweb.org/,">http://xwiki.objectweb.org/,</a> <a href="http://www.xwiki.org/%29">http://www.xwiki.org/)</a> and looking at
<br>
the relevant code right away. I estimate the following schedule::
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) exploring, and understanding XWiki components relevant for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;building P2P Xwiki :: 2 weeks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Conflict management and 1st deliverable  :: 3 weeks 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) P2PXwiki prototype with peer discovery, conflict management 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2nd deliverable) :: 3 weeks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) enhancements and possible XWiki interface (3rd deliverable) ::
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 weeks
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a head-start since I have already started exploring the
<br>
current XWiki. This will come in handy for a successful demonstration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bio
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Ph.D. student at College of Computing, Georgia Institute of
<br>
Technology, Atlanta. I did my undergraduate from Indian Institute of
<br>
Technology, Bombay and have a strong academic and research
<br>
background. My research interest is in distributed computing, in
<br>
particular Grid computing. I have worked on may coding and development
<br>
projects such as developing a specialized search engine for queries
<br>
related to database systems research publication, a distributed shared
<br>
memory system, and a secure grade management service. I have also
<br>
looked at research papers related to P2P systems.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The P2PXWiki presents interesting challenges and is also within the
<br>
scope of my interest in distributed computing ! I have won prizes at
<br>
TopCoder online programming competitions, and am recipient of the 2nd
<br>
prize in IBM North America Grid Scholars challenge 2005. I am
<br>
proficient in C, C++, Java, Perl, client-server programming, and am
<br>
willing to learn the required skills necessary for this project.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By participating in "Google Summer of Code", I intend to learn open
<br>
source software development and contribute substantially. I am excited
<br>
about the challenges in developing P2P XWiki (particularly for
<br>
conflict management, peer discovery encountered during the 2nd
<br>
deliverable), and will like to explore these issues even after the
<br>
Google Summer of Coding.
<br>
<br>
Although I am new to open source development, I have recently been
<br>
exposed to open source "Globus Toolkit" as part of my research work,
<br>
and am planning to make contributions to it as well by proposing new
<br>
services as part of my thesis.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my experience and interest makes me a strong candidate
<br>
for this project. Moreover, I have started exploring the code base for
<br>
XWiki, which gives me a early start. My mentor has provided guidance
<br>
and has suggested that the best way to learn the protocol interactions
<br>
are the XML-RPC API + ViewEditAction and XWikiService. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that I will need all my spare cycles to deliver
<br>
successfully on this project :), I like it and hope that I get the
<br>
chance to work on it as part of Google Summer of Code program.
