Other:
	1. Each test in a category (Account Suite, User Check Link Suite, Admin Check Link Suite, Edit Page Suite) can run alone.
	2. User Check Link Suites calls other suites in User Check Link Suite and Admin Check Link Suites calls suites in Admin 
		 Check Link Suite. My objective is to make these suites run automatic.
	3. In left screen, the unit is marked '!!!' - it's only a comment, it's not an unit. After running, its status is TODO
		 Because the unit cannot run well in webunit test. In the file, you will see the unit is commented out and there's a 	
		 COMMENT above
