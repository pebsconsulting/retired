This is a generic cache system. It transforms hierarchical structures in a 
sequence of static texts and dynamic nodes.

For example this cache is used by the template system. This system transforms 
XML into a sequence of static text blocks corresponding to HTML tags and dynamic
nodes corresponding to GWT widgets. This cached sequence is used as a template
for generation of new form  widgets. In this way it is possible to skip the XML
DOM serialization step for each new form widget.
