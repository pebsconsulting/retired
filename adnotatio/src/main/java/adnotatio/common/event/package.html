<p>This package contains a generic notification system used to dispatch events to
corresponding  registered listeners. Clients can create their own events and
register the corresponding specific listeners.
</p>
<p>
This system was designed to properly handle situations when an event listener 
fires a new event.
</p>
<p>It has no external dependencies and it can be used on the client side as well
as on the server.</p>

<p>Example of usage of this event system:</p>
<pre>
//A new user-defined type of events
class MyEvent extends Event {
    String fMessage;
    public MyEvent(String msg) {
        super(MyEvent.class);
        fMessage = msg;
    }
    public String getMessage() { return fMessage; }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventManager manager = new EventManager();
        // Registers a new listener which is notified about all MyEvent events
        manager.addListener(MyEvent.class, new EventListener() {
            public void handleEvent(Event event) {
                MyEvent e = (MyEvent) event;
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        });
        // Now we fire a new event
        manager.fireEvent(new MyEvent("Hello, world!"));
    }
}
</pre>
