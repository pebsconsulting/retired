         not defined. Seems to be fixed in the latest Surefire plugin in Maven's trunk so when
         2.3.1 or 2.4 is out, switch to it and remove this dependency. -->

            <!-- The remote resources plugin adds its output directory as a resource directory
                 so that the Maven resources plugin copies these resources to target/classes.
                 However copying them to target/classes will make them appear in WEB-INF/classes
                 in the generated WAR since the WAR plugin copies resources in target/classes in
                 WEB-INF/classes. Thus to prevent this we're binding this execution to a phase
                 that comes after the execution of the resources plugin (which executes in the
                 process-resources phase). Thus this remote resources plugin will execute just
                 after the resources plugin and the resources won't be copied, which is why we're
                 adding a webResource configuration element below in the WAR plugin's
                 configuration. -->
