How to use the files found in the formEditor folder from the XWiki SVN?

The FormEditor page must contain the code form the formEditor.vm.

This is the first version and is not integrated in the XWiki engine. All the files from this directory (including png graphics) must be attached to the FormEditor page (formeditor.vm).

builder.js, controls.js, dragdrop.js, effects.js, prototype.js, scriptaculous.js and slider.js are part of the Script.aculo.us JavaScript framework.

How to make new field?

Make approproate png graphics. Its name must be the same as the field type. E.g. if the field type is Boolean, the picture must be names "Boolean.png"

In the init() function, find the next rows:

	var arrNewFields = [{type: 'String'},
						{type: 'Number'},
						{type: 'Password'},
						{type: 'Date'},
						{type: 'Boolean'},
						{type: 'StaticList'},
						{type: 'DBList'},
						{type: 'TextArea'}
						]
Add the new field type in this array.

In the generateField() function, new form element must be created for the new field. Do that by adding appropriate 'case' block in the switch statement.
