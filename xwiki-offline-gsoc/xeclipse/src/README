The directory structure may appear strange but it's required by the Maven PDE plugin.
See http://mojo.codehaus.org/pde-maven-plugin/usage.html for more details.

XEclipse is made of the following plugins and features:
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.core
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.ui
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.xmlrpc
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.feature

To build XEclipse you have 2 options:
 * Build the Eclipse plugin.
 * Build a standalone RCP application.

Building the Eclipse plugin
===========================

1) Checkout the trunk: "svn co http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/xwiki-extensions/xwiki-eclipse/trunk/"
2) cd to trunk/features/org.xwiki.eclipse.feature.
3) Do a "mvn -DeclipseInstall=/AbsolutePath/To/Your/Eclipse/Installation" compile.
4) You should now have a org.xwiki.eclipse.feature_1.2.0.SNAPSHOT.bin.dist.zip file in this directory.

In order to install:

1) Unzip org.xwiki.eclipse.feature_1.2.0.SNAPSHOT.bin.dist.zip into your Eclipse directory.
2) Run Eclipse.
2.1) If XWiki Eclipse doesn't show up anywhere (for example when you open the Window->Show view->Other... dialog)
     then you might need to re-run Eclipse by specifying the -clean switch on the command line.

You can start using XWiki Eclipse by creating a connection using the File->New->Other... menu command.
XWiki connections will be accessible from the Project Explorer and XWiki Navigator.

Building the RCP application
============================

Please refer to:
http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/xwiki-extensions/xwiki-eclipse/trunk/plugins/org.xwiki.eclipse.rcp/README

Troubleshooting
===============

In case of a Linux installation, the Web preview requires that XEclipse is launched with the following environment variables:
* MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME pointing to the directory containing a Firefox executable (ex: /usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.6/)
* LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the directory containing Firefox libraries (ex: /usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.6/)

Enjoy.
