0) In order to compile this version of XWiki Eclipse RCP you will need to download from 
   http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ an Eclipse SDK 3.4 and the corresponding RCP SDK and delta pack.
   
   You will need to download from
   http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.4-200806172000/index.php
   
   - SDK: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.4-200806172000/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-SDK-3.4-macosx-carbon.tar.gz (Choose the right one for your platform)
   - RCP SDK: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.4-200806172000/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-RCP-SDK-3.4-macosx-carbon.tar.gz (Whatever platform is fine)
   - Delta Pack: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.4-200806172000/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-3.4-delta-pack.zip

   You might not need to download the SDK if you already have it installed on your system.
   
   Unpack the SDK and rename its directory to a meaningful name like eclipse-SDK-3.4, different from the standard one 'eclipse'
   Unpack the RCP SDK and the Delta Pack. Then you can rename the standard 'eclipse' directory to eclipse-RCP-SDK-3.4 (though it's not necessary).
   
   Renaming the SDK directory is necessary (if unpacking in all the files in the same directory) because otherwise the RCP SDK and the
   Delta Pack will be unpacked in the same directory of the SDK (i.e., 'eclipse') and this would cause build errors.
   
   The underlying principle is that at the end of this step you must have the SDK separated from the RCP-SDK + DeltaPack.      

1) You must provide a profiles.xml file containing the value of eclipseInstall, eclipseRCPSDK and pdeBuildVersion,
or set them up in your settings.xml or pass them on the command line.
To can obtain the pdeBuildVersion by looking at the version in $eclipseInstall/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_pdeBuildVersion.

For example, create the following profiles.xml file next to this pom.xml file:

<profilesXml>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>vmassol</id>
      <properties>
        <eclipseInstall>/path/to/eclipse-SDK-3.4</eclipseInstall>
        <eclipseRCPSDK>/path/to/eclipse-RCP-SDK-3.4-DeltaPack</eclipseRCPSDK>
        <pdeBuildVersion>3.4.0.v20080604</pdeBuildVersion>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>vmassol</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</profilesXml>

Example on the command line:
mvn install -DeclipseInstall=/path/to/eclipse-SDK-3.4 -DeclipseRCPSDK=/path/to/eclipse-RCP-SDK-3.4-DeltaPack -DpdeBuildVersion=3.4.0.v20080604 ...

2) You must also tell maven the target platform you want to build for. Valid values are:
   linux, windows, macx86 or macppc.

Example on the command line:
mvn install ... -Plinux

3) If maven complains that he cannot find startup.jar then copy ${eclipseInstall}/plugin/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher*-xyz.jar
   to ${eclipseInstall}/startup.jar.
   
Build with "mvn install".
