  <h1>XWiki Workspaces Overview</h1>

  <p>XWiki Workspaces is a powerful yet easy to use collaboration solution, organized around the concept of spaces.</p>
  <p>Every user is provided with a personal space where he can store & organize his information. Users can also create work spaces where they can invite their coworkers to work together and share information about specific topics & projects.</p>
  <p>Each space can have the following applications: Wiki, Blog, Photos, and Files. Other applications might be added in the future, but the main idea is to Keep It Simple, and not to clutter the wiki.</p>
