<h2>Editor design</h2>

<p>The editor uses the model-view-controller design pattern to
separate the presentation from the markup. The view is provided
by a textarea element that passes user interface events to the
controller. The model is clean markup. The controller keeps track
of which part of the view and which part of the model the text
caret is in. Keystrokes are handled according to the context in
which they appear. This approach takes over the behavior of the
textarea element to provide an approximation to wysiwyg editing.</p>

<p>One issue is keeping track of the caret position. On Gecko-based
browsers, field.selectionStart, field.selectionEnd and
field.setSelectionRange() are very useful and also work on Opera.
For IE you have to use the TextRange object, but note that this isn't
available on IE Mac. With work arounds you can reliably find the
current caret position and insert characters at that position.</p>

<p>Opera sets the key code to zero for Delete, Home and End, but this
should be fixed when Opera 9 is finally released. The Home and End
keys don't cause keypress events on IE but do on Opera. All browsers
allow you to prevent the default behavior provided you cancel on
keydown, keypress and keyup. This involves using a global to get
keypress and keyup to also cancel with keyup responsible for clearing
the global.</p>

<h3>Slide Templates</h3>

<p>I could get by to start with using two templates, one for title
or cover slides and the other for regular bulleted list slides. Each
template has fields that you can click on. When the field is undefined
it shows an explanatory text, e.g. click to add title. This disappears
when you click on it and restores if you move elsewhere without having
typed, or if you delete what your wrote before.</p>

<h4>Editing behavior</h4>

<p><strong>Enter</strong>:In a list item, the first Enter starts
the next paragraph. The second Enter starts the next bullet. To indent
or outdent a list item as a whole, you click on the appropriate button
or press tab or shift+tab. These keys are suppressed and not entered
into the text. In a paragraph, Enter starts the next paragraph.
Paragraphs can be turned into list items and back again using the
list buttons. The controller takes care of providing the enclosing ul
and ol elements.</p>

<p><strong>Backspace</strong>: This behaves as normal with the enclosing
markup being adjusted as needed. The exception is for elements that
are part of the template, which can't be deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Delete</strong>: This behaves as normal with the enclosing
markup being adjusted as needed. The exception is for elements that
are part of the template, which can't be deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Cursor up/down/left/right</strong>: these work as normal
with the controller tracking which object the caret is in.</p>

<p>The controller should provide context sensitive hints. An open
question is whether the tags should be shown in the view. Users
wouldn't have to type them as they would be inserted automatically
by the controller. The attributes would be hidden. Ideally, you would
be able to switch the presence of tags in the view on or off.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define a dom tree for the slide as the model. This could be part
of the document that is hidden from view, or it could be referenced
only by a JavaScript object. The former approach lends itself to
providing a wysiwyg view.</li>

<li>Define handlers for classes of key strokes according to the
context in which they appear.</li>

<li>Define a mapping from the model to the view and bind the low-level
key events to the controllers handlers.</li>

<li>Add a toolbar of basic editing functions, e.g. lists, indent
and outdent, weak and strong emphasis.</li>

<li>Extend model to support template functions</li>
</ol>

<p>Some more details. If the caret is at the end of a paragraph
and you press Enter, insert a new p element after this one, make
it the active element, and insert \n\n into the text buffer. If the
caret is in the middle of the paragraph, append a new p element,
and split the text between the two. Insert \n\n into the text buffer
and place the caret at the start of the new paragraph. If the caret
is at the start of a paragraph, pass the event to the parent element
together with a reference to the p element.</p>

<p>A list item is handled in much the same way. Shift+Enter could start
a new paragraph within the list item, wrapping the existing text within
a preceding new paragraph as needed. The ul element would handle Enter
by passing the event to its parent. This parent is given a reference
to the ul element.</p>

<p>Setting a paragraph to be a list item replaces the p by a ul or ol
element with an li element that wraps the content of the former p
element. If the preceding or following element is the same kind of
list (ul or li) then the two are merged. Setting a list item to be a
paragraph has the inverse effect.</p>

<p>The indent action causes the contents of a list item to be wrapped
in the appropriate ul or ol element. Three spaces are inserted before
it in the text buffer. This action appends the new list as a child of
the preceding list item. What if it was the first? The merging rule
then applies. The outdent action has the inverse effect. If the action
is applied to a paragraph, it is passed to the parent element.</p>

<p>In some cases users might be surprised by the effects of an action.
This indenting the first list item isn't permitted since it would leave
an outer list item with no initial text which feels wrong. This can be
explained in a hint section outside of the text area field. The same
thing applies to indenting and outdenting paragraphs that are not within
a list item.</p>

<p>The above suggests that keydown and keypress event handlers need to
classify events and pass them as actions to the controller. The controller
returns a boolean indicating whether the event is to be cancelled or not.
Alternatively it could insert a character and adjust the caret position
to offset the effect of the default handling of that event.</p>

<p>The actions can be associated with handlers associated with the
element types. In other words, the controller does a lookup of element
type and action to determine which handler to invoke. One way to implement
that is via setting action handlers on the DOM nodes. Another is via
using an array per action and named lookup e.g. obj["p"]["delete"].
Note that clicks have to be intercepted and the caret moved to the
nearest legal position.</p>

<p>Slides can be represented as an array of div elements, with the
controller being bound to a specific entry and the means to move
between entries, keeping the view in sync. To save the presentation,
the array has to be serialized to a string together with the corresponding
prologue and epilogue. The prologue includes the document head and the
presentation background div elements,</p>

<p>To edit an existing presentation, the editor uses Ajax to load
the document into a buffer and to transform that into the corresponding
arrays. In principle, XMLHTTP will create an XML DOM tree, but what if
the document isn't well formed? An alternative is to use a hidden iframe
element and to walk the iframe's DOM instead of creating arrays. The
controller can them provide code for inserting new slides, updating
existing slides, and deleting old slides.</p>
